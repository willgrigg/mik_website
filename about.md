Hello, I'm Mikayla!

![image-center]({{ '/images/stand.png' | absolute_url }}){: .align-center}

I am a handcrafted jeweler based out of Idaho. I started a small jewelry stand in 2008 as a side hobby, which eventually grew into a life passion. I have been making jewelry and refining my technique ever since.

If you like my work, I would love to discuss requests and special projects with you (I love creating unique pieces!) My e-mail address is: <strong><a href="mailto:madebymikaylastore@gmail.com">madebymikaylastore@gmail.com.</a></strong>
